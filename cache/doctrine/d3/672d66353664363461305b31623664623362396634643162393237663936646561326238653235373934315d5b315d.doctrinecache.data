Bouncing back and forth across walls like a rampant tennis ball. A lone lampshade upon a desk emits a pale, sickly glow upon the weathered face. </p>
<p>A single tear like bead of glistening sweat trickles, slowly down the from the slick, glistening, oily hair along the cracks and crevices of his pock marked cheek. His eyes darting in rhythm across the web page in feverish, macabre excitement. Its your Facebook profile. his hand glides the mouse with an air of familiarity. </p>
<p>He’s copying and pasting your address into his phone right now and just in case his shrewd, keen mind forgets your face. The ones he’s gazed at for weeks through your plethora of photos he’s downloading and printing your picture too. His hands shaking in anticipation he picks up his car keys, the chair scrapes as he stands up. With a hunched shuffle he lurches to the door and is gone picture in hand…
Of course this probably won't happen. Its an excerpt from a social media campaign a few years ago which with your consent uploaded your Facebook information, pictures and so forth into a short horror film to highlight the dangers of foregoing your privacy online. </p>
<p>We happily forego not only our privacy but, our safety as well. On an evolutionary level privacy acts as a safeguard against people in our circles. For instance, in war, opposing armies do not share intelligence, strategies and such like with one another. It is not any different in real life. Knowledge is power, the more knowledge one has the more power one has. By consistently sharing our whereabouts, likes, dislikes and friends we are needlessly endangering
ourselves. We are giving other people knowledge to who we are as a person. </p>
<p>I believe we fail to see the importance of privacy in regards to our safety. For example, in recent times the use of cyberbullying through social media has led to the deaths of many young people throughout the world including this country. Their dreams, hopes, aspirations never to come true. This foregoing of privacy highlights the its function as a safety measure. Imagine privacy as a window. Pre Facebook, the shutters are closed, blinds drawn. With every piece
of information we share we are pulling those blinds inch by inch, little by little back. Ask yourself? Where are my blinds now? Halfway? Perhaps fully open? We are giving danger a window into our lives, inviting it into our homes. Privacy is not just another word for alone time, it is our own safety in this hostile world.
Last Friday, I walked or should I say limped home.</p>
<p>I was exhausted in body and in mind. Weary with the week's social interaction and increased physical workload of school work. Not only was my bag heavy with books but, my mind also preoccupied with the weeks bombardment of mental assault courses; meeting up with friends, social circles, keeping track of goings ons. After a week of running this mental marathon, I relaxed at home and was myself. Or was I? My mind wandered, ”what about Facebook? Instagram? I have to share
that picture, oh! And reply to that message too... We have to continue leading our social lives even in our own homes. </p>
<p>Like master strategists the great general Bonaparte would be proud of how we carefully articulate our posts, editing each little word and ruminating over every element before sending it out onto the frontlines of Facebook. This intrusion into our privacy is a strangling grip which constricts our true personalities, quirks and idiosyncrasies. We are forced to carry on these uber filtered, pristine lives we act online as a result of this assault on our privacy. Privacy
is vital for our development as human beings. </p>
<p>In the dystopian future novel, 1984, by George Orwell, the populace has been turned into a flock of sheep, devoid of personality or beliefs. The reason? A totalitarian government has unrestricted access into each citizen's life. A war on privacy. We have taken privacy for granted reaping the benefits, failing to notice the intrinsic need for it. i believe we are in a war with ourselves over privacy. Everytime we post something that does not resemble our true selves
we are losing a part that makes us well, us. </p>
<p>We are living a double life as a result of this intrusion on our privacy. It makes one think. When was the last time I shared or posted something that was in accordance with myself or my beliefs? That was a true representation of myself as a person? I feel this highlights the importance of privacy as a way of developing and knowing ourselves and who we really are.</p>
<p>It’s a classic challenge of mine. Staying focused. Keeping in tune with an orchestra is how I think of it, attempting to study. It’s hard to stay focused on your instrument when all these other instruments are playing so beautifully in the background. Be it Facebook, Twitter or Instagram notifications looming in the back of my mind. Once I give in to their inviting embrace I am bombarded with the same messages from Facebook,”Hi Rowan! Mind telling us how old you
are? Where you’ve lived, studied?” The intruding, persistent questioning you would only ask someone on a fourth or fifth meeting are irritating at first glance but, far more troubling upon closer inspection. </p>
<p>When did this intrusion become normal? Commonplace in a way? Technology like a slow dagger has sunk, little by little, year by year, into our privacy. A recent Facebook intern uncovered a ‘glitch’ in the Messenger app which even when location services were turned off tracked your movement with each text sent. Facebook fired him promptly and buried his work. New technology poses a fierce challenge to our privacy as even the companies use your personal viewing habits and
likes/dislikes to tailor your ad selection to boost their profit margins. </p>
<p>Who can be trusted in this world when businesses sell your privacy to the highest bidder? How much is privacy worth to you? Is it worth a few more details on your profile page? Technology is a worthy adversary to our privacy but, there is one far greater. More powerful and he/she is standing in this room right now…</p>
<p>Of course it is ourselves. No thing nor person in the world poses more of a threat or challenge to privacy than ourselves. Facebook, Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter and so on wouldn't exist without us. They say the greatest opponent in life is ourselves. After all who is writing down all this information, posting pictures of ourselves, writing status updates. We routinely and punctually write and publish our lives online like a congregate of eagre
authors. Naively and gleefully giving up our storyboards, thoughts, and musings to the master publisher who owns all the rights to the stories of our lives. </p>
<p>Privacy begins and ends with us. Only now are we starting to realise the true meaning of it. I believe it begins by identifying the challenges which wage war on our privacy daily. That is us. However we can choose, choose to decide what we share. After all it comes down to a simple question which only you yourself can answer. To share or not to share? That is the defining question in the challenges to our privacy.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
