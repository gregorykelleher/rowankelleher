a:2:{s:7:"content";s:5709:"<p>In the early hours of Wednesday the 20th of September 2017, a category 5 hurricane - christened Maria - made landfall on Puerto Rico. Its inhabitants awaited its arrival, some 60,000 of them in darkness from loss of power to Hurricane Irma the week before. By daylight, the tenth most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record and the worst storm Puerto Rico had seen in 80 years - had left its mark.</p>
<p>Remnants of homes and businesses lay devastated in its wake with meteorologists declaring it a ‘direct hit’ likening its impact to a “buzzsaw” severing the island in half. The struggling power supply as a result of Hurricane Irma became a crippled one leaving any sewage or water facilities unusable. Overnight Puerto Rico had become a disaster zone.</p>
<p>Washington’s response to the crisis was anything but encouraging. A scant FEMA task force was dispatched alongside the legal waving of the ‘Jones Act’ (an archaic shipping statute which had delayed initial aid efforts) but was not renewed upon expiring.</p>
<p>Punctuating the tragedy were the cryptic remarks of President Donald Trump announcing incoming aid whilst in the same breath hinting at FEMA’s withdrawal on Twitter. And later the 69 Republicans who voted against a relief package for Puerto Rico, their reasoning being the increases it would have on the budget deficit.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico has always been an oddity in the makeup of the United States. For a country that was built upon the principles of liberty, equality, representative government and its support for the self-determination of peoples. The island territory has routinely contradicted these ideals.</p>
<p>Puerto Rico first came into US possession after the successes of the Spanish-American war, where a defeated Spain was forced to cede many of its colonies in the Caribbean to the American government of the time under President William McKinley. Long coveted by US military commanders for its strategic location, Puerto Rico was seen as the beginning of US naval dominance in the Atlantic to rival the Royal Navy. With militaristic ambitions front and center the inhabitants of Puerto Rico came a distant second, military rule was soon established and all state officials were hand picked by Washington.</p>
<p>Democratization came along slowly in the ensuing years. A lower house of representatives was established in 1900 granting the island limited self-governance under the the Foraker Act, but was ultimately a placebo with an upper-house and governor still chosen by Washington. Efforts to integrate the island into the US sphere of influence by granting Puerto Ricans American citizenship under the Jones-Shafroth Act of 1917 was met with resistance from the Puerto Rican lower house. </p>
<p>They eyed the implicit motivation behind the bill to recruit troops for impending US involvement in World War 1, since Puerto Ricans were now citizens they could be conscripted. Despite much opposition from the Puerto Rican people the bill was signed dashing any hopes of sovereignty.</p>
<p>Flash forward to today and independence is the last thing on the mind of many Puerto Ricans. As inhabitants of what is called an “unincorporated territory”, they cannot vote in Presidential elections nor elect representatives to Capitol Hill. With no political capital they are unable to shape policy or make the significant decisions that affect their country. This fact is a continuing source of ire for many and has fuelled recent attempts for recognition from Washington, as seen in the 2012 referendum where 61% of the 78% registered votes were cast in favour of statehood.</p>
<p>Since this plebiscite (and a 2017 referendum) the US government has dragged its heels in putting the result into action. Reasons abound for the delay with politicians pointing mainly to Puerto Rico’s flailing economy suffering under a $70 billion debt burden which mainland USA would be forced to take on if statehood was granted.</p>
<p>But listing the numerous excuses doesn’t account for the philosophical reasoning behind the marginalisation of Puerto Rico, which has always been defined by its strategic value to the US. During the height of the Cold War 25 bases were in operation with the largest - Roads Roosevelt Naval Station - facilitating US invasions of the Dominican Republic and Grenada. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1992 and therefore the cold war, the bases lost their raison d’étre and so did Puerto Rico. Roads Roosevelt closed its doors in 2004 ending most of the US military presence on the island, effectively leaving Puerto Rico adrift in Washington’s eyes. </p>
<p>If it was no longer a military site then what was it? This uncertainty has been the mainstay in successive administrations reluctant to deal with the contradictions and ethical questions the island presents to American values.</p>
<p>Many Puerto Ricans unsatisfied with Washington’s inertia are being proactive. Closely modelled on the ‘Tennessee Plan’ (which gave Tennessee statehood) Governor Ricardo Rosselló has formed the Democracy Commission which is comprised of two senators and five representatives from different backgrounds and political beliefs. The bipartisan commission will be responsible for lobbying Congress to advance the cause of statehood. Unfortunately it can only be granted by a vote in Congress and with healthcare reform and tax cuts dominating the conversation, statehood is not yet a priority.</p>
<p>Regardless of political persuasion, reform is needed to finally give Puerto Ricans a proper say in how their country is run. Be that statehood or outright independence - one thing remains clear -the US must act.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
