<p>A few months ago there was a viral photography circulating around the web among social networks such as Facebook and Twitter. It was a picture of twenty or so suit-clad individuals standing in front of a rather colourful assortment of flags staring stoically and admittedly uncomfortably into the lens of a camera. </p>
<p>By any other rationale this picture would be seen merely as a picture and nothing more. It wasn’t. In the picture, there were many shades of black and grey suits and very few pastel or primary coloured suits. In other words, uproar was generated over the lack of women and abundance of men at the G20 leaders’ summit. </p>
<p>This was the most prominent detail taken from perhaps one of the most significant meetings on the international calendar. Little trivial details such as the importance of combating populist arguments against globalisation or climate change or large scale tax evasion were aptly forgotten. Instead, the public became fixated by the gender of the politicians present instead of the progress that was made. </p>
<p>This has become a worrying trend in recent years and I feel that by implementing gender quotas we are encouraging this needless distraction but more importantly irreversibly damaging our democracy and disparaging women.</p>
<p>As a man much older and wiser than me once said - "government of the people, by the people, for the people.” That principle still holds true today. Our democracy can only exist if we believe that we have the choice to decide who represents us best, that each citizen knows their vote counts and that each individual has equal opportunity to enter public office. The implementation of gender quotas threatens many of the principles we associate with a true democracy and in parts tarnishes it completely.</p>
<p>In Ireland, for example, The Electoral Amendment Political Funding Act  was signed into legislation, passed by Oireachtas na hÉireann in July of 2012, wherein it states that certain parties must have a 30% quota of women candidates or face 50% cut in state funding. </p>
<p>These parties currently include the most prominent groups in Ireland’s political landscape including Sinn Féin, Labour, Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance. This strong-arming of the government into casting token female candidates has greatly impacted on our political process, most prominently in the 2016 election.</p>
<p>This was most notable in the Fianna Fáil candidate voting convention which took place in the Longford Arms hotel, on the evening of the 29th of October 2016. As it happened the 300 or so members of the Longford-Westmeath Fianna Fáil cohort had amassed in the hotel to vote for their choice of candidate who could best represent the region in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>This was the purpose of the meeting until a directive was sent by party headquarters that Gerety Quinn would be the chosen candidate for the constituency without a single vote being cast in her name. Furthermore, it was soon revealed that in a local radio interview she had earlier disclosed her disinterest in running, “I am making it very clear, that I am not going to go on the gender ticket. I would not, I could not. I have more respect for myself and indeed for my colleagues.” A first time candidate, she placed seventh in the overall vote count.</p>
<p>In another instance, in the Cork East election there was more controversy regarding the calling back of Barbara Ahern who had been in Gibraltar for the past two years working as an accountant and tax advisor. The purpose? To encourage her to run in the Cork East constituency as the FF female candidate alongside Kevin O’Keefe. In the election, Ahern came in a distant fifth with a 1,858 vote deficit with the next candidate, Sinn Féin’s Pat Buckley.</p>
<p>In these cases not only was the individual's right in the party convention to vote compromised but also their ability to choose who could best represent their constituency’s needs. As shown in both cases, the candidates failed to become elected thus signalling their failure to best connect with their constituency.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this new legislation gravely undermines these key concepts of democracy but also undermines an individual’s ability to enter office based on their gender. According to Article 16.3 of the Irish Constitution it states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No law shall be enacted placing any citizen under disability or incapacity for membership of Dáil Éireann on the ground of sex or disqualifying any citizen or other person from voting at an election for members of Dáil Éireann on that ground.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is evident that this new legislation directly contradicts the very fabric of our democratic society - our constitution. Any quotas violate the ability for a qualified and suitable candidate to enter onto the ticket as they are dismissed because of their gender. This is not only true for men but women too as there is a quota of 30% reserved for men under the Act. </p>
<p>A democracy should be built upon capable, qualified and experienced representatives. Those factors alongside the citizen’s right to have their vote counted and to choose who represents them should be the only reasons that a person is denied public office. A person’s gender should never dictate this as it clearly violates the democratic process as seen in the Gerety Quinn and Ahern fiascos.</p>
<p>Apart from this violation of our law, from a social perspective this policy is grossly condescending and demeaning to women. More worryingly, it promotes the spread of a phenomenon known as ‘Imposter Syndrome’. This is a term coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Dr. Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes referring to “high-achieving individuals marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a fraud. </p>
<p>Their behaviour to avoid being exposed only exacerbates feelings of inadequacy and self doubt and thus the cycle repeats itself. High achieving women such as Sheryl Sandberg the Chief Operating Officer of Facebook and Supreme Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor have admitted to suffering from the condition.</p>
<p>Moreover it has been reported extensively within the African American community in the USA who were notably receivers of affirmative action in the 1960s with many progressing into positions of responsibility within the public service.</p>
<p>In fact, most minorities are frequent sufferers of ‘Imposter Syndrome’ including women within government. Ergo, this new legislation only supports this as it reinforces the idea that women entered public office based on luck, chance, charm or external forces - and not on the basis of their own merits.</p>
<p>I believe we live in a fractured and deeply divided society which is only worsened by the media’s and our attention on what are essentially inconsequential matters such as gender quotas. The simple fact is that our political process should not be governed by the race, gender, sexual orientation, or religion of our politicians. </p>
<p>The truth is representation predicated by one’s gender damages the integrity of government, which is to represent our communities and the country regardless of gender, race or other such factors. Even if we used the argument of representation as proposed and assigned seats to each minority in Ireland it would be a disaster - simply because there are too many minorities: Polish, Black-Irish, Traveller groups, Muslim and so on.</p>
<p>We can see this most recent delusion of representation in the American election between Donald trump and Hillary Clinton. Repeated arguments were put forward by the Democrats enthusing the idea that Hillary could make history and become the first female President, shattering that highest of glass ceilings. Instead of galvanising support it pushed away people and alienated many groups. </p>
<p>She mainly polled unfavourably with men by this rhetoric and this was instrumental in her losing the election to a sexist and a bigot. Therefore, this much touted idea of representation is simply polarising and divisive. It does not achieve its aim of representing minorities. It only serves to alienate other groups.</p>
<p>I maintain that the only way we can heal the recent divisions in our society is to rediscover what our role is as citizens. We must raise the issues together as citizens, not men and women, to our government and place the onus on them to deal with what we believe are important problems within society. As a divided society, arguing amongst ourselves only benefits people in power as it distracts from their decisions.</p>
<p>In closing, It is extremely encouraging to see young people exercising their democratic right to freedom of speech and assembly in the marches for the repeal of the Eighth Amendment. Such examples of political and societal awareness must be commended as such examples are becoming less and less prevalent as we become bogged down in the issues of gender quotas and representation. I hope we can continue to act as responsible citizens, to educate ourselves and focus on what really matters - holding people in power accountable and ensuring fair, transparent representation of the people and their aspirations, hopes and ambitions.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
