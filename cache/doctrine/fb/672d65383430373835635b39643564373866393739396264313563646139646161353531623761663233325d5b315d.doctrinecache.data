A barren, desolate place of death and despair. All was quiet in the misty fog of a bleak, chilling November morning save for the encroaching sound of many hurrying boots. The noise drew nearer, the squelching and splatting of the foot deep mud, boots sinking into the cold, dark void, the suction of it, like quicksand dragged men to their knees. </p>
<p>Puttees clung to shins, loose pieces of the fabric cloth, flailed and flapped, their colour long gone, submerged for hours in the murky waters of the trench. They hurried on, cursing the inevitable sound of clinking helmets, bandoliers, trench shovels, canteens anything which made a sound.</p>
<p>Harry Crawford groped his way through a sea of mist. His eyes glanced down to his uniform, the familiar khaki, the trousers stained a dull brown, his dress shirt still engrained and permeated with the dried, encrusted blood of a friend, a  victim of a sniper the day before. His chest heaved in and out , the cold November air made each breath a painful exercise to his raw, chilled lungs. He continued on glancing at his watch, “only a few more seconds”, he wheezed to himself. He moved his feet again.</p>
<p>This time they wouldn't. The mud had claimed another victim. A crater half filled with a lime green layer of a sickly pus lay over the stagnant, putrid water, loomed in front of him. The cold is what he felt first, it hit his face with such a biting, piercing force. He flung his arms out flailing helplessly for anything which could rescue him from this abyss. His hands grasped something solid and course. He latched onto it and dragged himself to the sloping comfort of the crater’s rim. His rescuer looked up at him, the black sunken eye sockets, hollow, glared into his. A sickly, pale face, ravaged by rats. </p>
<p>The skin hung loose, peeling off the stricken cheek bones. Flesh hung limp and exposed. The lower half absent, organs, slimy entrails lay vulnerable over the ground, stretched over the mud. The empty sockets stared unwaveringly into his own until the whining, remorseless whistle of a shell interrupted this hellish exchange. The smell of burning nitro-glycerine, smouldering gunpowder overcame his senses, his ears popped violently and his whole body twisted, warped and flung itself against the other side of the crater. An unrelenting blackness enveloped him.</p>
<p>The mist had cleared by the time he woke up. A tiring, pale blue sky greeted him with the last burning embers of the sun dying out on the horizon emitting a melancholic glow over the silent swamp of wire, craters and bodies. He checked his watch. Fifteen minutes past five. He had been out for over eight hours. He moved his leg slightly, no sudden movements, in case of a sniper eager to avenge the morning’s raid.</p>
<p>A dull, throbbing pain reverberated around his body, the nerves flowing in a cacophony of pain. He stifled a scream. He moved his body slowly, inch by inch until he was safely underneath the rim of the crater. The pain intensified now, he examined the wound. His shin or what used to look like a shin was a green, scarlet mix of uniform and ripped, lacerated flesh, a jagged piece of shrapnel lay deeply at the focus of the wound. Harry winced. It would be dark soon that was his only chance, under the cover of darkness he would be able to at least attempt a crossing of no man’s land. Barb wire, mines, patrols, stood in his way. He had no other choice and so he waited.</p>
<p>The last dying vestiges of the light faded into the horizon with the arrival of the dark embrace of the night. An eerie silence shrouded the mud laden bruised earth. Save for the lonely pattering and  plodding of one lonely soldier. The pain was unbearable, with each step, a shock wave of agony spread through his limbs. </p>
<p>His hands shook and were numb with the freezing, bitter night air. With each step he expected the whistle of a flare, the cruel firework, the symbol of his demise as the steely rattle of a machine gun would pierce the still night air and cut his life down like a scythe at harvest. As he trudged on, blood trickled from his wound, things swayed in and out of focus. He stretched out his arms in a vain attempt to balance himself. </p>
<p>He stumbled, crawled through endless pits of death, body parts lay strewn across the cesspool of the once field; hands, feet, arms half buried in the earth poked through like tree saplings. Death had reaped and sown its crop, the evidence lay buried in the khaki uniforms and steel helmets. Blood filled pools and stricken trees, all traces of nature and wildlife long since gone.</p>
<p>As Harry made his way across this God-forsaken land, he thought he saw a dim light in the distance. The comforting, flickering glow of a Davy lamp drew nearer illuminating the faces of amazed comrades under the shadows of the their helmet brims. The yellow glow drew nearer and nearer and he surrendered to its warm, inviting glow. Its light overcame him and he slumped down into the arms of his companions.</p>
<p>Harry visits that place every November. It’s getting harder, the limbs aren't what they used to be and his leg still aches from that fateful day alone. He limps through a track riddled with roots and consumed by a dense forest of deciduous trees of sycamore, oak, beech. He stops and examines a sunken area of land right by the path. Its covered in ivy and overrun by ferns and other flora but, he would recognise it no matter what. He glances left and looks upon a hollow tree, with gnarled, spreading roots, a soft perishing bark and a pithy inside.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
