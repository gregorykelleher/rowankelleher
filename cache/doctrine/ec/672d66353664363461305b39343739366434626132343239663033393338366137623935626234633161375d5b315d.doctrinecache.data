<p>Good evening chairperson, adjudicators, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Rowan Kelleher and today I will be opposing the motion that the ‘internet does more harm than good’.</p>
<h3>INVENTION</h3>
<p>The internet. An ever growing, hive of information that has changed our world as we know it forever.
Our ancestors told stories around camp-fires - their reach was limited by the reach of their own voice. </p>
<p>While literature was kept by the rich and powerful, the invention of the printing press by Johann Gutenberg made this empowering influence accessible to the many. Television and telephones further shrunk the world. And now the arrival of the internet has made the world into the global village it is today.</p>
<p>This degree of connection breeds new ideas and innovation quicker than ever before. The globalisation of knowledge feeds the globalisation of commerce and invention and competition, pushing us further and quicker. </p>
<p>The steam engine for example took more than a century from prototype to manufactured model because of the inability to share information and ideas. Through the internet synergies are made, knowledge is shared, advancement is made possible.</p>
<h3>SOCIALISING</h3>
<p>The invention of FaceBook has also changed the way we socialise for the better, now we can discover old friends and make new ones. It gives us an insight into other cultures, gives people with a common interest to connect together in ways never before thought possible.</p>
<p>On a more serious note it has changed the world as we know it, the Arab Spring of 2010 where dictatorships were overthrown was fueled by FaceBook. Rebel leaders planned and coordinated through the network. </p>
<p>It is the world’s forum. It is democratic. It’s global. It’s growing. Communication in the modern world is going places 15 years ago, we would not have thought possible. Imagine the level of communication in the next 15 years?</p>
<h3>BUSINESS</h3>
<p>The invention of the internet has given people a voice, especially businesses. Small time businesses now have a chance to break free from the shadow of the large multi national companies. They now have a market of 2 billion internet users to reach, all with the press of a power button. Sites such as ‘Kickstarter’ allow these businesses to receive funds from crowdsourcing, already over a billion dollars has been invested in products on this site.</p>
<p>Businesses are not the only benefitters but, consumers too. Before the internet, we would have had very little information on products we would have relied on salespeople to inform us. Now we possibly know more than the salesperson, reviews, opinions, word of mouth by consumers have been given a megaphone online which can make or break products, forcing companies to produce excellent products of high quality.</p>
<h3>END</h3>
<p>Lastly, I will finish with this point. The internet is merely a reflection of human society-it shows the limitless imagination of mankind but also its fragile and dark side. However, as with any society a degree of common sense is involved for exploration. Ladies and gentlemen, the genie is now out of the bottle and awaiting our wishes! Thank you.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
