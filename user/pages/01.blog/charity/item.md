>> I wrote this speech in 2015 for the Europe Direct Soapbox finals when the homelessness crisis in Ireland and the refugee crisis in Europe were reaching boiling point. 3 years later not much has changed and both issues are still without clear, long term solutions from national governments.

Natalie lies in the doorway of Footlocker on O’Connell street. Cold, starving, exhausted. She still can't believe she's here. Unable to sleep her mind skips back to last year. Hospital bills, social welfare, overdue mortgage payments. Her home now a distant memory. As people pass over her she feels invisible and helpless.

At this same time, a world away. Ahmed clings desperately to the sides of a dinghy as it rolls across the choppy waters. As the spray hits him he thinks back to his home or what's left of it among the ruin. His family now drifting from town to town. He alone sent with all the they had. To find a job, a better life, support his family in Syria. The sea gets rougher now, water creeps in over the sides...

So today, we have a huge amount of money here in my hand. A sum which could change their lives. The question is who do we give this to? Should we rely on our friend ‘Charity begins at home’ and give this to Natalie. She is the one closest to home. But, in saying that are we being hypocritical. Years ago in the countrysides of Ireland, Irish people were dying from starvation and disease because The Famine. Local landlords were indifferent yet we received charity from societies abroad. When we emigrated to America people cast a blind eye to visas or passports.

Surely then we must donate this money to Ahmed. This young man has suffered greatly at the hands of western interference. His life over before it even began. However, then we forget Natalie who's suffering such poverty and hardship.

It’s simple. We can’t make a decision. But, we can make the decision on how we view poverty. I believe we’re all guilty of dealing with poverty by lines on a map. The truth is poverty is a human disease, it infects humans not borders. A long time ago, a hut was our home and the only people we knew were a mile down a dirt track we relied on them for charity. Today, our home is the world, our neighbours are everywhere in this global village. Upon this thought I think a change to the motion is necessary, ‘charity begins at home’? No.‘Charity begins everywhere’.
