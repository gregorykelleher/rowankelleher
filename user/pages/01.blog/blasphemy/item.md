**Introduction**

Divorce in Ireland has made great strides in little over a century. From its ban in the 1937 Constitution to the passing of the 15th amendment in 1995, it has now become a familiar and socially acceptable means of resolving marital breakdown. Although our modern understanding of divorce is limited to this brief synopsis, its origins are a compelling case study of a conservative society’s social progression through legislative reform. This article therefore seeks to discuss the status of divorce before 1937, how its unavailability influenced its 1937 ban and lastly how legislation led to the passing of the 1995 referendum.

**History of Divorce Law**

Contemporary Irish divorce can trace its roots back to the passing of the ‘Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Act of 1857’ in England, which transferred divorce proceedings from the ecclesiastical courts to the civil courts. Prior to this legislation divorce could only be granted through an annulment or a private bill in parliament which was an expensive and embarrassing ordeal requiring public debate about a couple’s marriage. 

As Ireland was tied legislatively to England the Act was expected to be implemented but never was. Irish citizens still had to petition parliament or avail of the ecclesiastical courts which many did not, records showing only 39 divorces between 1857 and 1910 at costs exceeding £300 in 1853. Even when proceedings were transferred to the civil courts in 1869 their powers were limited, unable to decide property or custody disputes and restricted to administering legal separation (not remarriage) on grounds of adultery, ‘unnatural practices’ and “certain forms of cruelty (such as nagging, spitting, refusing intercourse…)”.

Divorce remained unpopular in Ireland not only because of its unavailability but the changing attitudes towards marriage. After the ‘The Great Famine’ of the 1840s many families began to safeguard against future catastrophes by consolidating their wealth, with marriage providing the best means of transferring assets between families to ensure economic security. This financial prudence came with a social cost resulting in a decline in the marriage rate with many couples marrying less and later in life from waiting on inheritances.

A newfound appreciation of marriage grew in Irish society as a result of this decline and it became something to be valued and protected. Opposition to divorce became the norm and was reflected in the first Irish Free State government of 1922 where standing orders prohibited the introduction of private bills of divorce to parliament. A TD named Eamonn Duggan also voiced society’s hostility to divorce by amending the Constitution to include the provision, “subject to the public order and morality” in the personal rights section. A preemptive effort to preclude any legislation on divorce or what was called “mormonism” at the time.

In the following years public opposition to divorce grew concurrently with the Catholic Church’s increased presence in the new state. Taoiseach Éamon De Valera seized upon the public feeling to bring about his vision of Ireland based on Christian morals and values codified in a written constitution. He consulted heavily with Church leader Archbishop John Charles McQuaid to incorporate Vatican teaching into his new constitution - ‘Bunreacht na hÉireann’. Although disagreeing over provisions to include like a ban on contraceptives, both men agreed that a prohibition on divorce would be included. Article 41.3.2 was their creation to ensure that “no law shall be enacted providing for the grant of a dissolution of marriage.”

The 1937 ban on divorce remained in Ireland until the divisive 1995 referendum on the 15th amendment which was passed by a slim majority of only 0.5%. What was seen as a sudden watershed moment in Irish history was actually the result of a decade’s worth of legislative activism by the government. The goal being to introduce divorce piecemeal to the Irish public in order to change attitudes and resolve the social injustice of its ban.

The source of the 1995 referendum success was its 1986 counterpart which ended in a crushing defeat for the government and their supporters. Rushed and lacking political consensus the campaign was a foregone conclusion. The pro-divorce side drastically underestimated the power of the anti-divorce lobby specifically the Catholic Church who pressed on the legal uncertainties of divorce such as alimony and inheritance, something the executive failed to provide for in legislation if the amendment was to be passed.

Constitutional legality was also raised by claiming that legalising divorce was an attack on the family, something which was meant to be protected under Article 41. In the end, the result was 63% in favour of upholding the ban. 

In the intervening years the government learned from its mistakes and prepared for another referendum. To lay the groundwork and resolve pressing issues in family law the executive introduced a wealth of new legislation. These were targeted to address the issues raised by the anti-divorce lobby during the referendum and dealt mainly with children and separated wives. Among the most significant legislation was the ‘Status of Children Act 1987’ which removed the discrimination between children born inside a marriage and outside (‘illegitimate’ children), treating them as equals in matters of maintenance and inheritance rights. 

Vulnerable women also benefited from the new legislation especially from the ‘Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989’ which extended the grounds for legal separation, granted the courts powers to distribute property among partners and make maintenance orders for dependent spouses. It also recognised a person’s work in the home and included it as a factor in its orders. The passing of this legislation was vital to revising the stigma around divorce in Ireland and was paramount to the success of the 1995 referendum featuring heavily in the ‘Right to Remarry’ campaign. 

**Conclusion**

The origins of divorce law in Ireland are a fascinating microcosm of the interconnection of law and society. From its beginnings in the late 19th century to its ban in the 1937 Constitution and eventual legalisation in 1995, it has shown how the law can reflects society’s prejudices but also its desire for positive change.
