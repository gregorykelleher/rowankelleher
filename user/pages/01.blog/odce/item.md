**Introduction**

On the 23rd of May 2017, Ireland witnessed the end of its longest ever criminal trial as Judge John Alymer directed the jury to acquit the defendant, former Anglo Irish Bank Chairman Seán Fitzpatrick, of all charges against him under the ‘hidden loans controversy’. The public and media alike castigated the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement (ODCE) as the public body deemed responsible for the failure of the prosecution.

Amongst the ODCE’s numerous failings were the shredding of documents by Chief Prosecution solicitor Kevin O’Connell, who later admitted to having no experience in criminal law nor as lead counsel. Witness coaching and cross contamination of witness statements amounted to what Aylmer J denounced as “...an inappropriately biased and partisan approach” undertaken by the ODCE. In lieu of these findings over what was and still is an incredibly sensitive public issue, criticism railed against the ODCE and calls for a fundamental reshaping of the Office abounded.

But in light of these significant failings and withdrawing from the sensationalist media commentary that surrounds the case, are the criticisms of the ODCE accurate? Is the agency simply another example of bureaucratic overreach? This essay will argue that the ODCE does play a significant and meaningful role in the enforcement of company law within Ireland. It will prove this thesis by detailing how the ODCE was born into a complex and poorly designed regulatory environment which inhibited its performance. Its impact on the corporate enforcement landscape will also be shown to be effectual through its public awareness role. Lastly, potential reform will be reviewed utilising a comparative legal analysis formulated after Van Hoecke’s methodology.

**Section 1 - The Role and Performance of the ODCE**

The ODCE as a public body was first incorporated under the Companies Act 2001 as the institution responsible for the enforcement of the companies acts.  To achieve this aim, the Office was conferred with extensive investigative powers and prosecutorial authority in summary cases, with referrals to be made to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for indictable offences.  Its establishment was motivated in part by the corporate scandals of the 1990s which halted the Irish public’s apathy towards ‘white collar crime’. 

Amongst these controversies was the privatisation of the state-owned enterprise Siúicre Éireann in 1992, where managing director Chris Comerford was unveiled to have purchased a Siúicre Eireann’ subsidiary with public funds and sold it back to the state for a profit. Similarly, the Telecom Éireann scandal further raised the public’s ire when government appointed directors were found to have sold land to Telecom Éireann of which they were the actual proprietary owners. Scandals such as these changed the public’s perceptions of the traditional crime ‘on the streets’ to what has come to be known as crime ‘in the suites’ thereby creating a demand for a corporate enforcement agency.

The ODCE was born into this complex environment of corporate scandal and tasked with rectifying a culture of neglect towards company regulation since the birth of the State.  Its hasty establishment also reflects the wider failings of the State’s approach to regulatory enforcement. Unlike other EU members which establish regulatory frameworks and agencies prior to implementing legislation, Ireland’s approach has been ad hoc with agencies being established only when crises arise.  This has led to a proliferation of agencies which overlap in their regulatory authority and lack coordination practices.

The ODCE has been a victim of the careless implementation of what Pollitt and Talbott define as contemporary ‘governmental fragmentation’ (the decentralisation of executive power), in a system where seemingly distinct agencies such as the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) and the Central Bank (CB) share authority in some areas and yet not others. 

Hence, it may be submitted that the ODCE’s foundered performance in the Fitzpatrick trial may be explained in part by the surrounding regulatory environment that sustains uncertainty over an agency’s authority and inhibits coordination. Indeed, the public reaction to the trial’s collapse also reveals the misconceptions over the ODCE’s functions as many understood its role as being solely the state prosecutor of ‘white collar crime’.

**ODCE Impact on the Landscape of Corporate Enforcement**

In light of the above examination of the ODCE’s role and performance, it is necessary to analyse its impact on the landscape of corporate enforcement within Ireland. Although the ODCE has been criticised extensively for its prosecutorial function, its discreet role in encouraging compliance with the companies acts has been a resounding success.

This is due in part to the Office’s successful implementation of the Ayres and Braithwaite model of ‘responsive regulation’ - a graduated sanction system to enforce company law. Rather than the twentieth century approach of criminal sanctions, this model adapts a scaled strategy where the ODCE can firstly engage in a dialogue with the offending company, to issue a reminder to comply and a deadline to fulfill this request. 

Failing this procedure or from the company’s express refusal, the ODCE can escalate to administrative fines and civil actions, leading in extreme cases, to criminal proceedings and license revocation.

Most of the work conducted by the ODCE is concentrated in the lower regions of the pyramidal enforcement structure under ‘persuasion’. Indeed, as Gething notes, the Office has published volumes of material, such as the “Corporate Health Check”, which aim to encourage business owners to adhere to their basic company law obligations. Other methods have included delivering presentations and seminars to all interested parties to inform the public of their regulatory role. 

And as Professor Brennan notes, these efforts have been successful with 90 percent of Irish businesses in 2017 filing their company returns compared to the year 1997 (prior to the ODCE), where only 13 percent were doing so.

This model has been chiefly responsible for the ODCE’s successes in the landscape of corporate enforcement, by enabling it to refrain from investing resources in costly trial processes and ensuring compliance at the early stages of infractions. Further, it may be submitted that these preemptive actions prevent the usage of the ODCE’s intrusive investigatory powers which involve, amongst other measures, the appointment by application to the High Court of an inspector to the company  and a search warrant to inspect the company premises and dwellings. 

It must also be noted that in Re National Irish Bank (No.1), Shanley J deemed that this ‘power of search’ was not to be afforded the same legal protections as expected under traditional due process rights as it was a ‘non-adversarial process’.  

Such extensive powers are questionable in their application, particularly when the majority of businesses within Ireland are ‘small to medium’ (10 to 250 employees) sized enterprises that are mostly family owned.  This statistic undermines the populist perception of the large, faceless multinational corporations being subjected to dawn raids and instead reveals the reality of corporate enforcement which mostly targets domestic, family businesses. Hence, the investigative powers of the ODCE must be used scrupulously to avoid what may potentially amount to violations of criminal procedure in the landscape of corporate enforcement.

**Section 2 - The Need for Further Reform**

With the role, performance and impact of the ODCE on Irish company law compliance firmly reviewed, it is necessary to evaluate what reforms may be made to the Office. To conduct a comprehensive examination of these reforms, a comparative analysis formulated after Van Hoecke’s methodology will be used with Australia as the specified jurisdiction.

Firstly, as detailed extensively above, the ODCE has had major successes in encouraging the general compliance with company law obligations. However, as Lannon contends, this appraisal is misleading as it accounts for the public compliance of company law as implemented solely by the ODCE.  This fails to account for the dearth of private enforcement of company law as evinced by the lack of ‘derivative actions’ against directors or alternative mechanisms offered by the ODCE to concerned shareholders.

Indeed, only section 613 of the Companies Act 2014 provides a relief method for private parties which allows the courts to assess damages made by a director whilst in charge of a subsidiary and award compensation to an applicant if successful. However, in practise this has only been of benefit to liquidators rather than shareholders. Hence, an air of immunity abounds for many errant directors who slip the regulatory net of the ODCE and do not face a credible legal threat from private parties incapable of making a strong case.

On the contrary, the approach taken in the Australian jurisdiction by the ‘Australian Securities and Investment Commission’ (ASIC) in addressing the gap in private regulatory enforcement has been markedly more effective. Although aided by what Nic Bhlocsaidh describes as a ‘striking’ amount of funding , ASIC’s success can be characterised by its extensive range of legal support available to private parties. 

These measures include ASIC’s support of class action lawsuits brought by shareholders against company directors  and when in the public interest, it may fund further lawsuits brought by shareholders who cannot afford the legal costs. Further, even where investor class actions have failed, ASIC can still seek compensation on behalf of shareholders with their consent and within the public interest. 

These methods are a remarkable demonstration of the potential for a regulatory framework when both public and private enforcement procedures work in tandem.

Unfortunately, Ireland is by no means close to achieving such reforms. Indeed, in the wake of the Fitzpatrick trial, the Government published its white paper on ‘Measures to Enhance Ireland’s Corporate, Economic and Regulatory Framework’ which sets out its reform proposals to restructure and expand the ODCE into a commission with additional powers. 

None of which ensures that private enforcement measures (akin to Australia) will be implemented. Instead, it envisages an increased supervisory and investigatory role for the ODCE in corporate enforcement, with a ‘joint agency task force’ of Gardaí and experts to be established on a trial basis by the Minister for Justice to address complex ‘white collar crime’ (e.g. invoice redirection fraud, credit card fraud). 

It will also enable the appointed commissioner the ability to hire additional staff when required, although no details of funding were included in the document, which raises questions over whether these powers will actually be practicable. In reality, it may be submitted that this approach exacerbates the existing lack of coordination and information sharing between agencies and largely results in the same organisational issues which plagued the Fitzpatrick trial.

**Conclusion**

It is clear that any agency, when faced with the political and public fallout as experienced by the ODCE after the collapse of the Seán Fitzpatrick trial, would face penetrating questions about its functionality and hitherto existence. However, this essay has demonstrated that when viewed impartially, the view of the ODCE as an ineffectual and incompetent bureaucratic institution is inaccurate.

Its role and performance was critically reviewed, thereby restating its correct role within corporate enforcement and how it was disadvantaged by the regulatory environment in which it was founded. Further, it demonstrated how the Office’s impact on the corporate landscape is more accurately defined by its public awareness campaigns than its harsher prosecutorial and investigatory procedures.

Lastly, this essay presented potential reforms to the ODCE utilizing a comparative analysis of Australia’s corporate enforcement agency - ASIC. Unfortunately, such reform was inhibited due to the current government’s perceptions on regulatory practices which fail to account for the potential of the private enforcement of company law.
