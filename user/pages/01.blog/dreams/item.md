>> This piece came 3rd in the Callan Tansey essay competition judged by author and columnist John Waters. It was centered around the Easter Rising commemorations which gave me the chance to personally reflect on where Ireland was and where we’re going as a country.

“10:30AM. Just another thirty minutes and it’s break.” I whisper softly, struggling to hear even myself over the nonsensical utterances of rehearsing the oral exam. “Is mise Séan, cad is ainm duit?” A typical Irish class, I know it well after all; it's been nearly fifteen years. 

As still more unfamiliar words flood my ears, I divert my gaze from the frankly captivating tree outside the window, which I’ve been staring at the for the past ten minutes and towards more pressing matters. The Callan Tansey essay competition.

“In dreams begin...1916 rising...Yeats would think 2016 Ireland…” I mutter under my breath the key words, what would he think? Then chuckle to myself as it occurs to me in the most ironic class of all. Irish class. Surely, one of the founding goals in our struggle for independence was the salvation of our own language, I think to myself? 

Viewed as a distinct, cultural entity, their dream was for it to be flowing out every mouth in Ireland. Its flowing, delicate rhythm and tones to be woven throughout society. What went wrong? It’s not the students’ fault, nor the teachers’. The problem lies within the system itself. In 1916, it was an optional activity to be involved in such activities by the Gaelic League Association. A colourful assortment of sports and a healthy dose of language learning likewise. Although no one forced these committed souls to learn Irish, that’s exactly what’s occurring in 2016. 

The compulsory learning of Irish has been mandated by a handful of Gaeilgeoir, who have decreed that the forceful learning of Irish is the best way to learn Irish. Now we have thousands of children learning to hate the language instead, in a system perfectly engineered and designed for this role. The systematic neglect of our folklore and literature also being a disaster. Works which would have been championed and celebrated by Yeats and his peers now lie strewn by the wayside, lifeless and abandoned. I struggle to imagine how Yeats, nor his contemporaries would be proud of this misinterpretation of their own thoughts and views.

Of course, as I sit in my class contemplating the cruel, twisted fate of our language, I'm dragged out of my thoughts kicking and screaming by the incessant, up to date whisperings of the live pop culture stream occurring behind me. Spewing headlines of ‘Keeping up with the Kardashians’ & Kylie Jenner. Oh, and this just in - It’s official, infinity scarves are back ladies and gentlemen. As this wave of cultural mish mash, mixed with tabloid talk of a predominantly American nature crashes in on my eardrums, it wakes me up to another issue - the eroding of our culture. Never before have we experienced it like this.

Our already frail, crippled identity we’ve managed to cling to for the past hundreds of years lies weak and vulnerable. Briefly its flame was ignited by a few men’s efforts. Yeats and his contemporaries in 1916, lit the flame if only for a short while. Only to see their dream flicker in front of their eyes of a culturally rich Ireland, infused with Celtic myth and lyrical Gaelic prose. Responsibility then bestowed to future generations to stoke the flame, kindle it, until the flame grew into a fire unquenchable in every person’s soul. That ideal has not come to fruition.

The fire is down to its smouldering ashes, the unstoppable wave of social media, television and internet quickly eroding the last vestiges of our culture. Our meek attempts reduced to drunken acts of stupor in the form of ‘St.Patrick’s day’ or superficial Ceili dances cynically aimed towards tourists. Where is the pride of our heritage so often heralded by Yeats and his peers today? Worse still what would their reactions entail? 

Our budding eagerness to cling to anything which will gain us a brief, international, apathetic glance. Be it throwing a puppet on a song contest (Yes Dustin The Turkey I’m looking at you). Or pandering to a president to comb through his history to find some long lost relative who once talked to an Irish person. This would embarrass them to say the least. Over the years, we have grasped at anything which will gain us brief notoriety to the detriment of what Yeats and his contemporaries championed in 1916.

As the conversation behind me turns to matters beyond my comprehension and to be candid - my attention span, I glance towards the wall and stumble across a poster commemorating the centenary of 1916. A collage of muted, faint black and white pictures can’t drown the raw enthusiasm and passion exhibited by its subjects. Padraig Pearse’s commanding presence at the Fenian Rossa’s funeral, Connolly addressing crowds of thousands - these were men who could lead with such conviction and poise. Yeats himself led in his own way through his works and prose, igniting our people’s imagination and spirit. 

These men were leaders. Confident and assertive they believed in what they stood for, willing to put their dreams to the test and fulfill them, assuming responsibility in other words. Through their assured acts of leadership they provided a standard to adhere to, a vision of Irish politics not to be studied but, to be practised and lived. But alas, what they would think now would be utter disbelief. One struggles to see any traces of the dynamic and lively orators of that generation in today’s Ireland. 

When we look towards our political establishment we’re greeted with a myriad of cardboard cut outs sticking to regimented scripts, rehearsed lines and calculated rebuttals. Each parroting the other in deep fear of stepping out of line or ruinous exposure. All lacking in gumption and liveliness. Disillusionment is a term I would use to describe their reaction. It’s greatly disheartening to picture Yeat’s, Pearse’s or Connolly’s thoughts on this showcase of banal leadership. One can only imagine the level of incredulity and bereavement at the loss of our political spirit so alive at that time.

As my Irish class draws near to its timely end. So too does this piece. This year marks the centenary of the 1916 rising and with much reminiscing and fanfare to be had over the coming month I am left contemplating Yeat’s and his peer’s opinions over our celebrations. As I debate different views and ideas I come to an inevitable conclusion. Perhaps, they would be of a despondent disposition. The 1916 rising was a pivotal yet polarising moment in our history but it deserves to remain in history. After all, the minds of that time were always looking ahead in the hope of a free state, pursuing a distinct identity, always looking forward. 

Not to the past. I fear by looking backwards, we are going backwards. By celebrating such a polarising and controversial issue we are stirring up the turgid waters of bygone hate and tension; stoking the violent fires of distrust and suspicion.

The very title of this essay is “In dreams begin responsibilities”, however I believe we've too ardently fixated ourselves to a misconstrued interpretation of their dreams. In turn dutifully accepting responsibility of their perceived vision, subconsciously shackling ourselves to the stocks of the past. Imprisoning not only our outlook, but our language, culture and politics as well. Yeats, Pearse, Connolly and thousands of others were men who each had a belief of a free Ireland. 

However, as I look once more to the grainy pictures on the wall, I’m able to discern the real dream in which they strove. Our independent thought. The ability to formulate our own dreams. To assume responsibility for them and see it through to the end, as they all individually did.

And so this all boils down to a simple question, a question Yeats and his peers asked themselves one 
hundred years ago this month:

What is your dream of Ireland and are you taking responsibility for it?
