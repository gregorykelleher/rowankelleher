**Introduction**

The seminal decision in N.V.H marks a watershed in asylum seeker law in Ireland – a constitutional right to work now exists for asylum seekers. Despite the legal significance and opportunities borne from this ruling, much practical work is still necessary on behalf of the legislature to make this decision a reality for all and not the few.

**Facts**

The appellant was a Burmese national who sought refugee status upon arrival in Ireland. He was housed in direct provision where he remained after numerous unsuccessful applications. After six years he was offered employment. He sought the respondent’s permission to accept, but was precluded by section 9(4) of the Refugee Act 1996 which prevents asylum seekers seeking or entering employment pending their application’s final determination.

He sought a declaration of invalidity that section 9(4) was incompatible with the Constitution, inter alia, as it infringed on his unenumerated right to work. His claim was dismissed in the High Court by McDermott J and failed on appeal by a majority Court of Appeal (Hogan J dissenting). This case note discusses the Supreme Court ruling.

**Decision and Legal Reasoning**

McDonnell J ruled in favour of the appellant. He held that the absolute prohibition of employment for asylum seekers was an infringement on the unenumerated right to work.

McDonnell J addressed the appeal by answering the following questions - firstly, what is meant by a right to work? Secondly, can a non-citizen rely on fundamental constitutional rights? Lastly, can a distinction be made between citizens and non-citizens under this right?

Firstly, McDonnell J concurred with precedent that an unenumerated right to work exists in Article 40.3 of the Constitution. However, its scope is limited because it is a freedom to seek work not a guarantee of it. If the latter observation was true, it would make the State constitutionally responsible for providing employment - an impossible task, especially in a recession. UN Committees and the European Convention of Human Rights also support this interpretation.

Secondly, McDonnell J agreed, but was not satisfied with the case law, that non-citizens could rely on rights in the Constitution not tied to civil society such as voting rights. Instead, he cited the authority of Nottinghamshire and stated that rights relating to a non-citizens’ status as ‘human persons’ could be relied upon. Therefore, a right to work is valid for non-citizens because it endows human qualities of ‘dignity and freedom’.

Thirdly, McDonnell J held that a distinction does exist between citizens and non-citizens under this right. The regulation of entry into the workforce is a fundamental power of the State akin to immigration policy. Although an absolute prohibition on work is unconstitutional - limitations are valid under this power. Therefore, the Courts should not interfere because of infringement on the separation of powers.

**Persuasiveness of Decision**

N.H.V is a compelling decision because of McDonnell J’s test in determining non-citizens’ rights by their status as ‘human person[s]’ which provides a flexible and more unified approach than its Nicolaou counterpart. 

McDonnell J’s flexible test represents a divergence from the position in Nicolaou where constitutional rights were negated if associated with civil society, such as  voting. This approach proved limiting because it determined rights through a negative prism of what a non-citizen was not entitled to, rather than what they could be entitled to. 

Consequently, this influenced Finlay Geoghegan J’s Court of Appeal decision in N.H.V where a right to work was seen as relating to civil society because it constituted a ‘social contract’ between citizen and state. Under this reasoning, it is not difficult to imagine that rights of assembly or association could be curtailed because of their political nature and therefore link to civil society, thereby exposing Nicolaou tests’ limitations.

Accordingly, it does not provide a unified approach towards determining non-citizen’s rights. After Nicolaou, the Courts still did not have an applicable ‘unifying theory’ with the case law proceeding on a piecemeal basis. Admittedly, advancements were made as evinced by Re Article 26 which granted fair procedure rights but these decisions were disconnected without an encompassing logic.

McDonnell J’s test promises to be a thread which connects this case law under the umbrella term of ‘human person’ and embodies the values of dignity and freedom that the Constitution promotes. Rights which appeared to lack commonality can now be linked. For example, habeas corpus rights protect the individual’s liberty while fair procedures ensure non-citizens and citizens are held equal before the law preventing discrimination. 

This finding may not be viewed in isolation as other jurisdictions, such as the US, recognise a non-citizens’ rights to privacy and liberty among others - rights that again are unified under values of dignity and freedom.

**Consequences of Decision**

The immediate consequence of N.H.V is that asylum seekers will now have a constitutional right to work. To what extent they can exercise this right has been at the Government’s discretion - which has resulted in Ireland opting into the EU ‘Reception Conditions Directive’ (RCD). The RCD’s purpose is to harmonise conditions for asylum seekers, ensuring access to essentials such as education and healthcare across the EU.

Unfortunately - as with other European countries - this will this be of little practical benefit to asylum seekers.

The RCD entitles member states to implement their own regulation on labour market access - in many cases negating asylum seekers’ access. Germany is an example, where entry is granted but not if residing in an ‘initial reception centre’ from ‘a safe country of origin’.

Ireland’s restrictions are equally as limiting and contrary to NGO recommendations. Asylum seekers will be barred from entering over thirty employment sectors (social care, hospitality, etc.), a work permit worth €500-€1000 must be bought and the starting salary must be at least €30,000. This regulation effectively limits work access to highly skilled professionals due to employment sector restrictions and costs.

Accordingly, this raises ethical questions about the regulation’s motives. It would appear the State is only willing to accept its most qualified applicants - not its most disadvantaged. If N.V.H was meant to promote dignity and freedom through a right to work, the disregarding of these principles for economic interests is a poor reflection on the State’s human rights obligations. 

**Conclusion**

Non-citizens’ rights have come a long way since the late Henchy J’s pronouncement that the Constitution was one ‘of the Irish people [and] for the Irish people’. McDonnell J’s decision has brought clarity to the case law in providing a unified and broad approach based on inherent values. Our attitudes towards asylum seekers have also changed where we now assume our government is meeting its humanitarian obligations. It is timely that the Irish Government meet these expectations.
