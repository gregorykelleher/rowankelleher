**Introduction**

On the 26th of October 2018, Ireland voted in favour of the 37th Amendment to the Constitution removing the offence of blasphemy from Article 40.6.1 (i) by a resounding margin of 64.4% of the electorate.  Public commentary praised the result, echoing comedian Stephen Fry’s comments as another sign of the “new, tolerant, liberal Ireland” emerging in recent years. 

But has blasphemy’s removal achieved these ambitions? Is Ireland’s commitment to free speech as strong as we think it is? Unfortunately, as this article will contend, we still lack a robust constitutional guarantee of free speech within this jurisdiction. Despite the jubilations at the referendum result, there is still considerable work to ensure a true right to free speech exists in Ireland.
 
This article will defend this thesis by firstly presenting the two main philosophical conceptions of free speech: consequentialism and deontologicalism. This will facilitate a review of reform proposals in light of Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) to expand Article 40.6.1 ambit. 

**Theories of Free Speech**

In order to discuss Ireland’s attitude to freedom of speech, it is necessary to provide a brief explanation of its two main conceptualisations; consequentialism and deontologicalism. A consequentialist approach to free speech derives its value instrumentally, from its ability to produce social good within the community. Therefore, consequentialists value speech which promotes social harmony or democracy rather than speech, such as holocaust denial, which propagates falsehoods. 
 
On the contrary, a deontological perspective disregards the factual connection between utterances and positive results, instead deriving its value from the concept of free speech itself. Theorists consider the right to be inherently valuable, requiring no justification, and any intrusions should be viewed with suspicion.  Hate speech is acknowledged as an unfortunate result but, doubt is expressed over the capability of State institutions to counter its effects. 

Rather, more speech is seen as the antidote to such results by propagating a ‘marketplace of ideas’ whereby economic theory applies to promote truths. 
 
Although neither conceptualisation is perfect, this essay argues that the deontological approach provides a more substantial defence of free speech within society. Where the consequentialist theory fails, however, is that it requires the apparatus of the State to adjudicate on what constitutes hate speech and what does not, a task which States historically have failed to adequately accomplish.

**Consequentialism in the Irish Legal Context**

Article 40.6.1 is clearly a product of its time, moulded as it was in a young socially conservative State which still felt a threat from dissident republican groups.  Hence, Bunreacht na hÉireann with its consequentialist restrictiveness, differs greatly in its protection of free speech from other democratic countries, such as Germany and Canada. 

Firstly, it is necessary to examine Article 40.6.1 in order to gain a sense of this consequentialist approach. 

> “The right of the citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.
>> … shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.
>>>The publication or utterance of seditious or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable
in accordance with law.” 

Whereas other rights-based texts, such as the ECHR , focus on the individual’s right to free speech, Article 40.6.1°, qualifies it by connecting its use solely to the public interest. Indeed, this is evident in the words ‘conviction’ and ‘opinion’ which O’Dell construes as ‘subjective perceptions of fact’ related to democratic or political uses. 

Furthermore, the State’s regulation of what it deems ‘indecent’ speech or which undermines its ‘authority’ far exceeds ECHR qualifications where only a threat to ‘national security’ or ‘public morals’ may result in restriction. Clearly these qualifications are a degree more serious than opaque references towards ‘indecency’ or ‘authority’. 

**Proposals for Reform**

After considering the shortcomings of the Irish consequentialist approach, it is evident that a shift towards a deontological interpretation is warranted. The central proposal for reform is an encouragement of the Courts to shift towards an ECHR perspective on freedom of expression cases.  
  
Indeed, the Courts have increasingly drawn on the Strasbourg Courts case-law in recent years for supplementing their decisions and such an approach can only be welcomed.  However, an overreliance on this method - as Hogan cautions - is unsustainable. 

While it is commonplace that Courts will rely on foreign jurisdictions to inform their decisions, the ECHR Act 2003, which enables this action should be used only when all domestic legal processes are exhausted. Further, a sole focus on Article 10 for judicial inspiration may marginalise the Constitution’s role, stymying the development of jurisprudence for Article 40.6.1°. 

Instead, it is submitted that an amendment to Article 40.6.1° in line with Article 10 of the ECHR is necessary to implement the Court’s wishes. Such an amendment would replace the limiting words of ‘conviction’ and ‘opinion’ towards a neutral free speech guarantee, that acknowledges an individual’s self-expression. ECHR qualifications would be replicated including the threat to ‘national security’ while ‘public health and morals’ should replace the ‘seditious or indecent matter’ provision. 

Although these reforms are extensive and arguably difficult for the electorate to quantify in terms of their legal significance and value , they more accurately represent ECHR caselaw and place a higher burden of proof on the State.

Both of these approaches would push the constitutional needle towards a deontological approach of freedom of expression, circumventing the difficulties arising from the current consequentialist direction.

**Conclusion**

After the blasphemy referendum, it is hoped that Ireland has blossomed into a new era of nationhood, one characterised by democratic and secular European values. But as this essay contends, no better opportunity exists to prove this claim than in Article 40.6.1°. The restrictions of the consequentialist status quo have stunted the Irish people’s right to a fully realised right to free speech. Reforms proposed within this article will hopefully provide a brief insight into the possibilities for change that exist within the Irish Constitution, but also within the Irish people themselves.
