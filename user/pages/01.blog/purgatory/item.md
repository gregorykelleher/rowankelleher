>> For a country called the ‘land of a thousand welcomes’ the way we treat asylum seekers in Direct Provision system is one of Ireland’s greatest shames, as this essay explains.

Laiq looks around the single room he’s shared with his wife and three kids for the past eight years since arriving from Pakistan. 20 square metres, roughly the size of a hotel room. His tired eyes trace the room. 

A solitary, faded, plywood cupboard sits alone in a corner packed with their clothes and tightly squeezed in with their children’s toys, a delicate balance between recreation and functionality. Of course the kids don't see that. His eyes read over the same scene he’s seen a thousand times before. 

The dilapidated chairs, weary trodden carpet its original colour now but a memory. His children play close by with the same toy they've played with the past 4 years, it’s hard to buy anything when all you get is €19.10 each week.

He looks to his wife Aisha. She looks endearingly towards the children, her cheerful, buoyant face masking the anguish and hopelessness he knows she feels. He feels caught between his pending asylum application and the walls of his sanctuary - he’s in purgatory. When he left Pakistan he believed he was free. He wishes he could say the same now.

Laiq and his family are the victims of a system which has grossly been stretched beyond its already frail purpose. Now a hopelessly, mis-shapen shell of an idea the direct provision may be a well meaning notion in theory but, change is desperately needed.

Beginning in 2000 after a record breaking year of asylum applications (close to 11,000), a temporary, short term solution was needed and thus the ‘Direct provision and dispersal’ scheme was born. Originally, asylum seekers were granted a few weeks stay at a reception centre in Dublin then dispersed to centres around the country where a six month stay was planned as their application was processed. Families were entitled to three meals a day whilst a €19.10 social welfare allowance was distributed to each adult per week.

Today, the system has failed - often imposing a six year waiting time. In this period of time it fails the residents in innumerable ways. However, I shall focus on the children in the system, the mental health of residents and the application process to delineate how the system is not fit for purpose.

One quick google search of the Direct Provision system and it will result in dozens of pictures of cramped hotel rooms brimming with belongings, shabby buildings, run down caravans with worn out canteen halls as ‘recreational areas’, neglected facilities - tired buildings and tired people. More disturbing than the centres themselves is the effects it has on children and the numerous mental health problems among residents.

One third of all asylum seekers are children. These children must share bathrooms with adult men and women. This close proximity to mentally unstable refugees has lead to many problems. Social services are four times more likely to be alerted to child protection and welfare than the outside community, whilst authorities have been notified of cases of inappropriate sexual contact. This combined with lack of parental supervision, confined spaces and living under the constant fear of deportation is causing irreversible mental damage.

Furthermore, in 2013, the Department of Justice and Equality refused to accept that suspected abuse cases raised of children in these centres is not deemed worthy to be handled through the statutory complaints-handling framework of the Ombudsman for Children Act, 2002. Sadly, this is all that many of these children know. Born into a system which is failing these children in every way, it is completely unreasonable to therefore even suggest that the system is fulfilling its designated purpose.

Occupants are ten times more likely to suffer post traumatic stress disorder than the general community. Complete lack of privacy, loneliness due to language barriers, cramped conditions and uncertainty of future has resulted in at least 48% of asylum seekers suffering from poor mental health in Cork and Kerry alone. Anxiety, depression and insomnia are endemic in these centres.

Not only physically but mentally, these centres damage people irreversibly.

Adding again to this shameful category of failings is the outdated application system used. A convoluted, tedious system designed seemingly to create backlogs. Applicants must fill out a three tier series of applications. Due to the sheer numbers of applicants this process is painfully lethargic and archaic. This has led to asylum seekers waiting in some cases for ten years.

Even the legal advice granted to these people is woefully inadequate. Always seemingly concentrated in the later stages of the process, what little legal advice is given to the candidate at the start is useless as they must fill out the questionnaire themselves which has resulted in numerous first application refusals.

Originally, DP was a well founded and logical system - a short term solution for a short term problem. However, this original purpose has been dramatically changed in the last few years - thus prompting resolutions and adaptations to the system. With these proposals I believe the Direct provision structure will benefit greatly and reach its full potential. These include a review of the centres themselves and also the application process.

Tacking the subject of the centres firstly it is evident that they must adapt to the changing purpose of the DP system. I do not believe a complete replacement of the DP system is necessary but a financial injection is needed to improve the conditions and life within these centres. Such inputs would involve increased freedom for residents, créches for children, relaxed mealtimes, free transport to towns/cities and the locating of future DP centres closer to urban areas. Due to the lengthy waiting times rooms must be made larger for families, shared rooms phased out to reduce religious friction and study areas created for students.

Lastly and most importantly, the application process must be reviewed. More resources must be allocated to the bodies which handle these forms and documents to increase the rate of application acceptances. On the migrant’s behalf the methods behind the decision process must be improved by regular updates, regular contact between applicant and their Refugee Legal Service appointed solicitor. 

Furthermore, more assistance must be granted to the applicant to fill forms and sit interviews to improve their case and to avoid null and void applications. With these resolutions it will be possible to improve the rate at which applications are processed and dramatically reduce the populations and wait times within these centres.

On a closing note. One must ask how does this reflect on us, the Irish people? After all, we are seen as one of the most warm and affable nations on the planet but, within our societies behind closed doors, hidden thickly behind a murky veil of deceit, politics and ignorance lies the Direct Provision system. 

A system which has been publically decried by the UN. Our government is indifferent. Evidence of this is the prohibiting of media to access these centres, and yet we believe ‘Justice is transparent’? In closing, it can be summarised in a simple question, what do you want people to think of, when they think of Ireland?
