>> This counts among my less prepared speeches (typed it up with 12 hours notice) but still significant nonetheless. The EU comes in for a lot of criticism nowadays with Brexit and the rise of far-right populism  but, it’s important that we not forget the positive role it has played in Europe and Ireland.

Good evening chairperson, adjudicators, ladies and gentlemen, opposition. My name is Rowan Kelleher and I will be opposing the motion ‘that this house will dissolve the EU’. Today I will be speaking about Europe’s economy and its benefits to Ireland.

Firstly, lets wind the clocks back to the 50s and 60s. What was Ireland doing back then? The answer. Very little. We had begun to get on our feet but, emigration and heavy unemployment were taking their toll over 400,000 people had left. We were in a state of uncertainty, unsure of our place in the world.

### IRELAND ECONOMY

Ladies and gentlemen, we found our place in 1973, the European Union. Now 41 years later Ireland has improved in ways even the most optimistic supporters couldn’t have imagined. 700,000 jobs have been created since, our GDP has grown to 183 billion and we have a market of 490m people at our fingertips. Europe has invested €2.2 billion in the construction of roads by the ‘National Development Plan’ attracting MNCs such as Intel and bringing much needed business to the west and my hometown of Sligo and Galway of course.

It doesn’t stop there, no, not by a longshot. Education has improved greatly thanks to EU backing, in 1973 27,000 people were in 3rd level education now its over 160,000. Facebook, Google, Microsoft have their European Headquarters here due to this educated workforce. Business in Ireland can make use of free trade which means no import or export tax. Where would we be if none of this funding was given?

### WAR/FDI/POLICIES

Let me remind you of the original and overlooked purpose of forming the European Union and I quote “To preserve peace and liberty and to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe.” That goal has been achieved and for 56 years war has been avoided. The EU has been a part of the peace process between Northern Ireland and the south. Giving over 1 billion euro in cross border programmes and development of affected areas.

The achievement of the peace process has created an economically stable Ireland which has attracted billions of FDI. As well as this, the common agricultural policy has given much needed stability to Irish farmers. It has made Europe self-sufficient and less reliant on imports and more importantly has allowed me to enjoy my beloved Irish steak. Already over €44b has been given in CAP so far.

Upon hearing this motion I was deeply saddened. Saddened (look sad). That we, Ireland, who have benefited in so many ways from the EU are even contemplating dissolving it? The EU is a union of countries bonded by respect, integrity and equality. For 41 years we have proudly been a part of this and now we want to scrap it, to brush it under the carpet. We have shared Europe together, and I look forward to the future together! Thank you.

Upon joining the EuroZone we have received trading benefits as many EU countries use the euro which cuts down conversion costs and unites Europe. If one of us prospers we all prosper.
