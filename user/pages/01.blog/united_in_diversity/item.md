>> This was the last speech I delivered for the Europe Direct Soapbox competition. Although not qualifying for the finals it’s perhaps my favourite speech, granting me the opportunity to discuss the indifference towards Eastern Europe since the 2004 EU expansion.

In cooking there are three basic steps:

* Step one, place measured amounts of each ingredient in.
* Step two, be patient. Don’t add all the ingredients at once.
* Step three, stick to the recipe. If you’re unsure or it goes wrong stick to the instructions and see it through.

Ladies and gentlemen, the EU as we know it today is not the Michelin star chef we all believe it to be. It has become the equivalent of a smoothie blender. Quickly tossing random, clashing fruits in and pressing blend. Hoping somehow, a delicious, fruity concoction will appear. Instead a jarring and disorganised puree emerges. The key to a perfect dish, as any great chef will tell you, is when the ingredients are united in their diversity, celebrated by each of their distinguishing flavours.

What went wrong? How did such a pristine establishment which was so successful at marrying ingredients in gustatory harmony lose its way?

In 1973 and 1986 we had a five star chef within our kitchen, adding measured ingredients with patience and sticking to the time honoured recipe. Country after country, carefully incorporated to enhance the cultural flavour. It worked well and the customers were happy.

However, recently it seems that chef has left. And in his place the over enthusiastic waiter has stepped in. Throwing in varying amounts, rushing the cooking and ignoring the recipe. A jar of Poland, maybe a few dollops of Serbia and Estonia, a can of Latvia and why not a cup of Croatia?
Edible but an incomprehensible mess. Disunited in its diversity.

The EU has failed us. But more so the Eastern countries. Thrown in rapidly without due care, their cultures diluted in the race for an ever expanding consumer market.

We are the customers and it is up to us to send the dish back. It us up to us to go on Yelp, Tripadvisor to complain about the meal we are being served. Because as it stands today, ladies and gentlemen, the EU doesn't deserve a tip.
